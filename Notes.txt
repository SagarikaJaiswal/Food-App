-> Why do we use state?
   We use state to keep our UI in sync with the data.
   States are used beacuse react keep track of state variable.

   ## useState
   ===============
   1)React gives us the way to crate the local state of the functional component
   2)useState should not be called inside the if statement, for loop and outside the functional component

--> React is fast as it provides faster DOM manipulation(Virtual DOM). faster DOM manipulation is possible due to Diff algorithm.
--> Whenever the state of any local variable changes react re-renders the whole component, it quickly refreshes the whole component.

--> It is not a good practice to call an API inside the component because everytime the stateof any variable changes the component refreshes,
this will lead to unnecessay calling of the API multiple times increasing the latency.

--> IMP POINT - A component renders in two cases-
                  1) when the states change.
                  2) when the props change.

--> useEffect 
    1) It is a hook.
    2)This hook takes in two parameters, a callback and a dependency array (dependency array contains the state variable on whose state change the callback is called)
    3)This hook is used when we do not want to run a piece of code everytime the component re-renders.
    4) in case of empty dependency array - the callback is called once after initial render
       in case of any dependency - once after initial render + everytime after re-render(i.e when searchText changes)
    5) in case we don't pass the second argument then the useEffect is called after every Render
